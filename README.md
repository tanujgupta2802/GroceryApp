# 🛒 Grocery App (MERN Stack)

A fully responsive **Grocery Shopping App** built using the **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)**. This application allows users to browse grocery items, add them to cart, and place orders — all in a smooth and responsive UI experience.

The app is successfully deployed on **Vercel**, making it easily accessible and ready for real-world use. It delivers fast performance and adapts perfectly across mobile and desktop devices.
