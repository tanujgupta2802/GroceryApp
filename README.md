## 🙌 Final Words

This project was inspired by an open-source MERN stack application.  
I used it as a learning base and made several modifications to better understand full-stack architecture. From building the frontend UI to integrating backend APIs and authentication, this project helped strengthen my practical MERN stack skills.
